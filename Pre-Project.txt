🧠 Define Your App's Core Data and Flow
Before you touch code, design, or tools, define what the app is—how it behaves and what data it runs on.

✅ Step 1: Draft the Core Flow
Write this in plain English or sketch on paper:

User opens the app → sees a cologne card with info (name, brand, notes, rating).

User swipes right → fragrance is saved to their “liked” list.

User swipes left → fragrance is skipped.

User views their liked list.

(Optional) They can tap into a fragrance to see more details.

✅ Step 2: Define Your Data Schema
Make a basic table of what a fragrance needs in your app:

Field	Example
id	1
name	"Dior Sauvage"
brand	"Dior"
notes	["bergamot", "ambroxan", "pepper"]
image_url	URL to a bottle image
rating	4.6
type	"EDP"
longevity	"moderate"
sillage	"strong"

Also sketch out user data:

id

email

liked_fragrances: array of IDs

(Optional: custom tags, notes, rating, etc.)

✅ Step 3: Gather Sample Data
You’ll need ~50–100 fragrance entries for an MVP. Start by:

Creating a CSV or JSON file with fragrance data.

Include image URLs (can be placeholders from Unsplash or Fragrantica* if for demo only).

Don’t worry about copyright yet if you're just testing.

You can scrape or manually collect data for now, but this will become a serious consideration if you plan to publish.

✅ Step 4: Choose Your Tools
Once you have the flow and data:

Frontend: Set up a fresh Expo React Native app (npx create-expo-app)

Backend: Sign up for Supabase and model the fragrance and user tables

Design: Sketch 2–3 key screens in Figma (or pen and paper)

💡 In short:
Before anything else, get clarity on:

What the user sees and does (the flow),

What data powers the app (the schema),

And collect a little sample data.

Let me know when you’ve got that drafted, and I’ll walk you through setting up Supabase or the swipe UI next.
